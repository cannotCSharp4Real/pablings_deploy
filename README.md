Simple web project that made for e-channeling.
This project helps a barbershop establishment such as a customers to request an appointment with a barber online. This project can also help admins to manage the schedules of their appointments with their customers. This babrbershop appointment system will organize the schedules of each customer's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the barber they have selected. The system has 3 sides which are the administrator, the barber, and the customer. The system admin will populate the list of the doctors with the doctor's details and system credentials. The customers will browse the appointment system website to find a barber that has the specialty of their needs. The customer can check the barber's weekly schedule to help them to choose the day and time which they can comply for the appointment and they will submit their request for an appointment. After that, the barbers can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the customer for their availability.
